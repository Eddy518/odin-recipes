        <li>Prep time:<br>
            Get your ingredients ready beat the raw eggs in a small bowl, season with salt and pepper, and grate your cheese if it's not pre-grated. Also, warm that non-stick pan to a nice medium heat and drop in your butter or a little oil.
        </li>

        <li>Cooking time:<br>
            Now this is such an easy recipe the entire process takes just 5 minutes! Once the egg mixture hits the pan they're going to start to solidify so add the cheddar cheese on top of the eggs.

        <li>
            Mixing time:<br>
            Using either a silicone spatula or a rubber spatula, move the mixture into the center of the pan so it's away from the sides of the pan. Keep folding until the cheese is combined and the eggs are nicely scrambled.
        </li>

            To finish:<br>
            When the egg has no 'watery' bits left, you're done! Quickly remove from heat and transfer to the plate - on top of some lovely, hot, unbuttered toast.
